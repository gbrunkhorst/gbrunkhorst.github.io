## Career

*Environmental Engineer.* I'm an environmental engineer with 14 years of consulting experience on complex aquatic and upland cleanup projects.  My experience in environmental consulting is summarized [here](experience.md).  

*Pedagogue.* I taught high school physics and integrated science and have a Masters in Teaching from the University of Washington.

*Student.* I earned an engineering degree from Princeton University in 1999, where I split time between the environmental engineering and geosciences.  Afterward, I worked on several research projects related to nitrogen cycling in the environment.

*Free-spirit.* Between academia and career, I worked farming trees, greasing axel seals, selling ski boots, hocking Big Gulps, landscaping, tutoring, and cleaning toilets. I also hiked a lot of beautiful mountains and read a lot of good books.  

## Scientific Computing and Bayesian Statistics
Open-source scientific computing is my drug of choice, especially Bayesian Statistics and probabilistic programming.  The rest of this website is an introduction to Bayesian Statistics in Python through the lens of an environmental scientist, which I have been developing to promote my secret plan to turn the environmental cleanup industry Bayesian.  

This site is written using JupyterBook, which combines text, computer code, and visualizations.  Enjoy!
